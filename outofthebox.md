## Out of the box talks

Attending conferences can be amazing experiences: interesting people, great locations, and insightful talks. However, if you attend enough conference, or the wrong conference, you can succumm to one of the worst pandemics of our age. No, not 'conflu': death by powerpoint. 

Being on stage, with a microphone and a projector displaying slides means you have a captive audience. However, there is nuance, an art if you will, to being able to engage and teach an audience without falling asleep or checking just how good the conference WiFi is.  

There are many articles and listicles that detail basics: things like making sure you have no bullet points, no text smaller than 60pt on the screen, etc. 

However, there are better ways to convey your technical information and teach your audience: the "out-of-the-box talk".

Here are just some of my favourite talks that break the mould, speakers giving insightful and informative presentations with nary a bullet point in sight. 


### Popular Culture Analogies

One of my most enjoyed talks are those that share technical concepts but using analogies and popculture themes. 

In my experience, the most popular theme for these talks are Harry Potter (lore only, with full credit to the existence of the universe to J.K. Rowling.) 

Fellow writer [Lacey Williams Henschel](https://opensource.com/users/laceynwilliams) has presented two talks on this topic before at DjangoCon Europe 2016 with [Hermoine Granger and the Wizard Information System](https://www.elastic.co/videos/hermione-granger-and-the-wizard-information-system-by-lacey-williams-henschel), and DjangoCon Europe 2018 with [An Intro to Docker for Djangonauts](https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5jfDDg55xs). In her Docker talk, she was able to weave a narrative where she aligned `docker` and `docker-compose` commands with Harry Potter spells, a useful mnemonic for a person new to Docker. 

Lacey has also given talks from within the Pride and Prejudice universe in her DjangoCon US 2015 talk [Jane Austen on PEP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55gXwFviOuQ)

Lacey isn't the only speaker who has given magical talks; the closing keynote from DjangoCon AU 2018 was presented by Lilly Ryan, who gave a talk entitled [Django Against the Dark Arts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbwb6zqjZ7o), where she compared her profession as a security penetration tester to that of an auror, or dark wizard catcher. She analyzed the security precautions taken by Albus Dumbledore to protect the first book McGuffin, the Philophers (Sorcerer's) Stone, and picked apart the vulnerabilities that allowed the hoodwinking of the Goblet of Fire. 

Speaking of stories, Philip James has also taken children's books and used them to pace a talk, in his DjangoCon US 2016 talk, [Frog and Toad Learn About Django Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF0M-1OJlWI). By inviting the audience to 'story time', Philip 'reads' the story of Frog and Toad, but where Frog wants to build a site in Django, and Toad explains how Django can help that site be secure, out of the box.  

### Alternative History

It's not only established lore that can serve as a basis for framing a talk; you could always make your own future. 

Gary Bernhart took this trope at PyCon 2014 with [The Birth and Death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript), giving a 40-year history of JavaScript from 1995 through 2035. 

Along this same vein, Dr Russell Keith-Magee presented an apocryphal lecture [Emoji Archeology 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brNmfD1Lb7M&start=1470&end=1774), a reimagination of the history of emoticons and emoji while being historically accurate, is humourous in it's interpretation of a how such histories could be interpreted. 

### Performance Art

You don't have to have slides, either. There are a number of talks that use an alternative form of visual presentation. 

Grace Nolan took this further by interlacing her slides and live artwork creation during her PyCon AU 2018 talk [Reflections on the Creative Process - Illustrated with Watercolour Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fujTKJnesXI), where she spoke about watercolour painting, while painting on stage. 

### Not Slides

You could even ditch Keynote, PowerPoint, or LibreOffice all together and use your projector to display other content to support your talk.

From linux.conf.au 2011, Florian Haas presented [Roll Your Own Cloud: Enterprise Virtualization with KVM, DRBD, iSCSI and Pacemaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3cA0plS51E) while Tim Serong drew the slides, live in front of the audience. 

For the more pre-prepared style, Christopher Pitt proved you could present a talk in Minecraft in his Dutch PHP Conference talk, [Zombies and Binary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaL96bIZYqQ). He uses a simple game modification to add images to signs in game as his slides, changing slides by moving his avatar through the game. This talks centres on teaching of logic gates, which Christopher does by showing the crafting of Minecraft's redstone circuits. 


## Entertain, inspire, and delight. 

Hopefully one of these talks has piqued your interest, and the next time you see a call for papers, you might just submit something with a little bit of flair. Conference organisers love a good out-of-the-box talk.
